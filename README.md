##See Click Fix Pipeline

###Objective:

Following along a tutorial in the Data Engineering with Python book by Paul 
Crickard, this repository holds code from the example chapters as well
as the first pipeline I created using Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, 
and Python Pandas and standard libraries. The book relies heavily on a tool
called Apache Nifi which, while very useful for seeing the 
overall flow of a pipeline and having the potential for quickly identifying
tasks that need adjustment, I had some real difficulties configuring Nifi to
work in my environment. I'm not sure if this difficulty was due to the slightly
outdated nature of the code referenced in the book (Python 2 libraries were
used at one point, many now-depricated imports and methods showed up) or if my
system was just not configured correctly. Nevertheless I worked my way through
the SeeCLickFix project by converting the Nifi pipeline portions to Airflow
ones.
